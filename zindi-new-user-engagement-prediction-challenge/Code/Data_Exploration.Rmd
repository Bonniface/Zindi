# First look at our dataset

In this notebook, we will look at the necessary steps required before
any machine learning takes place. It involves:

loading all the data; looking at the variables in the dataset, in
particular, differentiate between numerical and categorical variables,
which need different preprocessing in most machine learning workflows;
visualizing the distribution of the variables to gain some insights into
the dataset.
